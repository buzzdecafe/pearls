A surpassing problem
====================

A _surpasser_ of an element of an array is a greater element in the tail of the array. 
So `x[j]` is a surpasser of `x[i]` if `i < j` and `x[i] < x[j]`. The _surpasser count_
of an element is the number of its surpassers.

Find an algorithm for finding the maximum surpasser in an array, and do so in
_O(n log n)_ time.
